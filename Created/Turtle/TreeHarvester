	Description: This program is used to automaticly chop down fir trees.  It is the first step in a fully automated Wood Farming Farm.
		This will be expanded out to allow the Turtle to dump the logs into a sorting chest and then refill fuel, bonemeal, and sapplings
		as needed.

  2/25/2013 Update
  ---------------------------
  Placed so that if you put a chest to the left of the turtle it will drop everything off from Slot 2 on.  This might
    in the future to allow for the ability of adding sapplings and bone meal to allow for automated planting and
    tree creation.  Currently the only problem is when you have to many leaves in the sky the tree will not plant.
    This currently works for all trees with 4 section bases.  I will be making a automated tree harvester for single
    trunk trees.
