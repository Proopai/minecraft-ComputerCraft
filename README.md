minecraft-ComputerCraft
=======================

This is for MineCrafts Mod ComputerCraft and interaction with the cool little things called Turtles.

This area is for all the code that is created for the minecraft Turtles based off the Lua programming language.
I will have both code that I have coded and code that other people have coded broken up into different sub-folders 
if I have made the code it will be in the Created folder and if it was found online or I have helped someone make it 
then it will be placed into the Discovered folder under the username of who it was that I helped or made it with a link 
to the location the orignal can be found if it is still available.

If you have any questions feel free to contact me but I do not make any assurances that any of this code will work for your 
turtles and not cause problems.  All code is provided AS IS and use at your own risk.
